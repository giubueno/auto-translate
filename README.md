A group of bash script and Python code to translate the audio of videos from English to other languages using cloud services.

2. Transcribe the audio using Whisper (locally).
3. Translate the transcription using OpenAI or Google Gemini.
4. Text to speech using OpenAI or Chatterbox TTS (for voice cloning).
